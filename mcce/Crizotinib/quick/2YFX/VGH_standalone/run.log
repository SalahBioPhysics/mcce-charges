|    MCCE (Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics)       |
|	is a program developed at Marilyn Gunner's lab.	      |
|	MCCE is a biophysics simulation program combining     |
|	continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics.     |
|	In this program, the protein side chain motions are   |
|	simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of   |
|	solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by	      |
|	continuum electrostatics.			      |
|	MCCE can calculate residue pka, cofactor Em and       |
|	protein PI in protein-solvent systems, and more:      |
|							      |
|	 - Protein structural responses to changes in charge  |
|	 - Changes in charge state of ionizable residues due  |
|	   to structural changes in the protein		      |
|	 - The structural and ionization changes caused by    |
|	   changes in solution pH or Eh			      |
|	 - Find the location and stoichiometry of proton      |
|	   transfers coupled to electron transfer	      |
|	 - Make side chain rotomer packing predictions as     |
|	   a function of pH				      |

Last Updates:                                              
10/27/2015, New Delphi Version v68                
12/1/2015,  In Yifan's monte carlo, now it takes energies.opp file as an input.
12/24/2015, Added flag for Gaussian smoothing, 1 means run Gaussian, 
            zero means run step function.  For more information visit
            http://compbio.clemson.edu/downloadDir/delphi/delphi95_manual.pdf 
12/29/2015, Added two flags for the use of Gaussian smoothing, sigma and srfcut.
02/01/2016, Added an extra column to the opp energy files.

Step 0. Initialize enviroment
   Load run control file "run.prm"...
   Done

   Tentatively load local param file "new.tpl"...   No such file, ignore.
   Done

   Load parameters from directory "/home/salah/mcce-charges/mcce/param04" ... 

   In file /home/salah/mcce-charges/mcce/param04/hec.tpl, parameter "CONNECT  HMC01  CAB sp2       0     C3B 0     CBB LIG   SG" is already loaded somewhere else.
   Try delete this entry and run MCCE again
   Done

   Load linear free energy correction parameters from "/home/mcce/mcce3.0/extra.tpl".../home/mcce/mcce3.0/extra.tpl
   File loaded.
   Done

Step 0 Done.

Not doing "Step 1. Test and format structral file"

Not doing "Step 2. Make multi side chain conformers"

Not doing "Step 3. Compute energy lookup table"

Step 4. Monte Carlo Sampling
   Load conformer list from file "head3.lst" ...
   Scaling factors:
   VDW0  = 1.000:
   VDW1  = 1.000:
   VDW   = 1.000:
   TORS  = 1.000:
   ELE   = 1.000:
   DSOLV = 1.000:
   Done

   Load pairwise interactions ...
   Done

   Verify self consistancy of conformer flag ...
   Done

   Do titration at 1 points...
   Detailed progress is in file "mc_out"
   Monte Carlo set up time: 0 seconds.
   Titration  1:     0 seconds, biggest stdev of conformer occ = -375.115
   Done

   Fit titration curves to get pKa/Em ...
   MFE: didn't specify mfe point, do mfe at pKa or Em 
   Done

   Total time on MC: 0 seconds

   Output files:
      mc_out          : MC progress and convergence.
