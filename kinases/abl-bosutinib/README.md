# Manifest

* `3UE4-pdbfixer.pdb` - Abl kinase (with heavy atoms and hydrogen added) complexed with bosutinib (DB8) containing only heavy atoms
* `DB8-extract.pdb` - bosutinib (DB8) extracted from `3UE4-pdbfixer.pdb`, only heavy atoms from X-ray structure
* `DB8.pdb` - bosutinib (DB8) with same atom naming as `3UE4-pdbfixer.pdb` with heavy atoms and hydrogens, possibly different atom ordering from X-ray
* `DB8.mol2` - bosutinib (DB8) with same atom naming as `3UE4-pdbfixer.pdb` with heavy atoms and hydrogens
* `DB8.tpl.pH-6` - MCCE2 topology file for DB8 with 18 protomers for pH 6; PKA entry holds effective pKa to get equilibrium populations right
* `DB8.tpl.pH-7` - MCCE2 topology file for DB8 with 18 protomers for pH 7
* `DB8.tpl.pH-8` - MCCE2 topology file for DB8 with 18 protomers for pH 8
* `epik-output.log` - log file output from Epik run for pH 7
* `run.prm` - example MCCE2 input file
