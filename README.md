This is a collaborative project between the [Gunner lab](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~gunner/) at CCNY and the [Chodera lab](http://choderalab.org) at MSKCC.

This project contains files for converting all small molecules in the PDB from the [Ligand Expo](http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org/ld-download.html) to work with MCCE.
