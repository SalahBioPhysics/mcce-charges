* `epik_inhibitors.py` - a script that uses the OpenEye toolkit to generate the geometry of the FDA-approved inhibitors from the SMILES representation in `clinical-kinase-inhibitors.csv` and runs Schrodinger's epik on them
* `output` - contains the `mol2` files generated with OpenEye and Epik's output
* `epik_inhibitors.log` - the `stdout` obtained by running `python epik_inhibitors.py`
